# Methodology

## Study Design

### Setting
- **Hospital**: Zakho General Emergency Hospital
- **Location**: Zakho, Duhok Governorate, Kurdistan Region, Iraq
- **Department**: Microbiology Laboratory

### Study Period
- **Duration**: November 2013 – November 2025 (12 years)
- **Data Collection**: Retrospective analysis of laboratory records

## Sample Collection

### Specimen Types
1. **Urine samples** (majority of specimens)
   - Clean-catch midstream urine
   - Catheter specimens when applicable

2. **Respiratory specimens**
   - Sputum samples
   - Throat swabs

3. **Wound and skin samples**
   - Wound swabs
   - Skin swabs
   - Ear swabs

4. **Genital tract specimens**
   - High vaginal swabs (HVS)
   - Cervical swabs

### Inclusion Criteria
- All clinical samples submitted for culture and sensitivity testing
- Samples with significant bacterial growth

### Exclusion Criteria
- Contaminated samples
- Samples with no growth
- Duplicate isolates from the same patient within 30 days

## Laboratory Methods

### Culture Techniques

#### Urine Culture
- Inoculation on CLED (Cysteine Lactose Electrolyte Deficient) agar
- Blood agar for Gram-positive organisms
- MacConkey agar for Gram-negative organisms
- Significant bacteriuria: ≥10⁵ CFU/mL

#### Other Specimens
- Blood agar (aerobic and anaerobic)
- MacConkey agar
- Chocolate agar (for fastidious organisms)
- Specialized media as needed

### Organism Identification
- Colonial morphology
- Gram staining
- Biochemical testing (API systems, manual biochemicals)
- Coagulase test for *Staphylococcus* spp.
- Catalase and oxidase tests

### Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

#### Method
- **Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method** (CLSI guidelines)
- Mueller-Hinton agar
- Incubation: 35°C ± 2°C for 16-18 hours

#### Interpretation
- Zone diameters measured in millimeters
- Results interpreted according to CLSI breakpoints
- Categories: Sensitive (S), Intermediate (I), Resistant (R)

#### Quality Control
- *Escherichia coli* ATCC 25922
- *Staphylococcus aureus* ATCC 25923
- *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* ATCC 27853

## Data Collection

### Historical Data (2013-2022)
- Extracted from laboratory logbooks
- Manual entry into spreadsheet
- Variables: Patient demographics, sample type, organism, susceptibility results

### Recent Data (2024-2025)
- KoBoToolbox digital data collection
- Standardized data entry forms
- Real-time quality checks

### Data Cleaning
1. Standardization of organism names
2. Date format harmonization
3. Antibiotic code standardization
4. Removal of duplicate records
5. Handling of missing values

## Statistical Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics
- Frequency distributions
- Proportions and percentages
- Temporal trends

### Resistance Rate Calculation

```
Resistance Rate (%) = (Number of Resistant isolates / Total isolates tested) × 100
```

### Trend Analysis
- Year-over-year comparison
- Moving averages
- Chi-square test for trend

### MDR Classification
Based on Magiorakos et al. (2012) definitions:
- MDR: Non-susceptible to ≥1 agent in ≥3 antimicrobial categories
- XDR: Non-susceptible to ≥1 agent in all but ≤2 categories
- PDR: Non-susceptible to all agents in all categories

---

## Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy
- All patient identifiers removed prior to analysis
- Only aggregate demographic data retained (age, sex)
- No individual patient tracking possible

### Institutional Approval
- Data collected as part of routine laboratory operations
- Retrospective analysis of anonymized data
- No direct patient contact

---

## Limitations

1. **Single-center study**: May not represent regional patterns
2. **Retrospective design**: Subject to data availability and quality
3. **Selection bias**: Only symptomatic patients seeking care
4. **Testing variation**: Not all antibiotics tested for all isolates
5. **Identification methods**: Phenotypic methods may have limitations
6. **Duplicate exclusion**: 30-day rule may miss some duplicates
